    I am fully responsible for the rigorous correctness proof: \\[3pt]

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Finished a proof of 20 pages contained in the \textsf{arXiv} version
      \item Identified several nontrivial bugs
            in the early versions of the protocol\footnote{
              One of these bugs also exists in the well-known Granola protocol
              proposed by James Cowling and Barbara Liskov,

\begin{frame}{Why \textsc{Uni-}?}
