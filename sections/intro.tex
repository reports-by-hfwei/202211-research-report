\begin{frame}{What is \unistore?}
  \begin{center}
    \unistore{} is a \red{fast}, \red{scalable}, and \red{fault-tolerant} \\[8pt]
    \blue{transactional} distributed key-value store \\[8pt]
    that supports a \red{combination of weak and strong consistency}.

\begin{frame}{Why \textsc{Uni-}?}
  \begin{center}
    Weak consistency: low latency, high availability

    \fig{width = 0.40\textwidth}{figs/best-of-both-worlds}

    Strong consistency: easy to preserve critical application invariants

    Causal consistency allows two concurrent \textsc{withdraw} \\

  \begin{definition}[Session Order]
    A transaction $t_{1}$ precedes a transaction $t_{2}$
